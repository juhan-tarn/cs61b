# Objects

####Defining and Instantiating Classes

Example:

```java
public class Dog {
    public static void makeNoise() {
        System.out.println("Bark!");
    }
}
```

To run the method in `Dog` class:

- add a main method 

  **OR**

```java
public class DogLauncher {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog.makeNoise();
    }
}
```



#### Instance Variable & Object Initiation

**Object Instantiation**:

Classes can contain not just methods, but also data.

Classes can be instantiated as objects:

- For example, create a single `Dog` class, and then create instances of this `Dog` 
- The Dog class provides a blueprint that all `Dog` objects will follow 

Example:

```java
public class Dog {
    public int weightInPounds;

    public void makeNoise() {
        if (weightInPounds < 10) {
            System.out.println("yipyipyip!");
        } else if (weightInPounds < 30) {
            System.out.println("bark. bark.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("woof!");
        }
    }    
}
```

Using the `Dog` class:

```java
public class DogLauncher {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog d = new Dog();//create an instance of Dog
        d.weightInPounds = 20;
        d.makeNoise();
    }
}
```



#### Observations:

-  `object` == **_instance_** of any class
- Class variables ==  **_instance variable_** or **_non-static variable_**. 
  - must be declared inside the class, whereas Python allows new variables to be added at runtime
- The method that we created in the `Dog` class did not have the `static` keyword. We call such methods *instance methods* or *non-static methods*.
  - If a method is going to be invoked by an instance of the class, then it must be non-static
  - Instance methods are invoked by instances 
- To call the `makeNoise` method, we had to first **_instantiate_** a `Dog` using the `new` keyword, and then make a specific `Dog` bark. In other words, we called `d.makeNoise()` instead of `Dog.makeNoise()`.
- Once an object has been instantiated, it can be *assigned* to a *declared* variable of the appropriate type, e.g. `d = new Dog();`
- Variables and methods of a class are also called *members* of a class.
- Members of a class are accessed using **_dot notation_**.



**Constructor Example: **

```java
public class Dog {
    public int weightInPounds; // instance variable

  /*Constructor*/
    public Dog(int w) { // the instantiation is parameterized
        weightInPounds = w;
    }

    public void makeNoise() { // Non-static method OR Instance Method
    }
}
```

```java
public class DogLauncher {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog d = new Dog(20);
        d.makeNoise();
    }
}
```

The constructor with signature `public Dog(int w)` will be invoked anytime that we try to create a `Dog` using the `new` keyword and a single integer parameter.

```java
public class DogLauncher {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      Dog smallDog; // Declaration of a Dog variable
      new Dog(20); // Instantiation of the Dog class as a Dog object
      smallDog = new Dog(5); //Instantiation & Assignment
      Dog hugeDog = new Dog(150);//Declaration, Instantiation & Assignment
      smallDog.makeNoise();
      hugeDog.makeNoise();//Invocation of Dog class's instance method
    }
}
```
