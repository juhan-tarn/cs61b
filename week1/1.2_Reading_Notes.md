# Objects

####Defining and Instantiating Classes

Example:

```java
public class Dog {
    public static void makeNoise() {
        System.out.println("Bark!");
    }
}
```

To run the method in `Dog` class:

- add a main method 

  **OR**

```java
public class DogLauncher {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog.makeNoise();
    }
}
```



#### Instance Variable & Object Initiation

**Object Instantiation**:

Classes can contain not just methods, but also data.

Classes can be instantiated as objects:

- For example, create a single `Dog` class, and then create instances of this `Dog` 
- The Dog class provides a blueprint that all `Dog` objects will follow 

Example:

```java
public class Dog {
    public int weightInPounds;

    public void makeNoise() {
        if (weightInPounds < 10) {
            System.out.println("yipyipyip!");
        } else if (weightInPounds < 30) {
            System.out.println("bark. bark.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("woof!");
        }
    }    
}
```

Using the `Dog` class:

```java
public class DogLauncher {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog d = new Dog();//create an instance of Dog
        d.weightInPounds = 20;
        d.makeNoise();
    }
}
```



#### Observations:

-  `object` == **_instance_** of any class
- Class variables ==  **_instance variable_** or **_non-static variable_**. 
  - must be declared inside the class, whereas Python allows new variables to be added at runtime
- The method that we created in the `Dog` class did not have the `static` keyword. We call such methods *instance methods* or *non-static methods*.
  - If a method is going to be invoked by an instance of the class, then it must be non-static
  - Instance methods are invoked by instances 
- To call the `makeNoise` method, we had to first **_instantiate_** a `Dog` using the `new` keyword, and then make a specific `Dog` bark. In other words, we called `d.makeNoise()` instead of `Dog.makeNoise()`.
- Once an object has been instantiated, it can be *assigned* to a *declared* variable of the appropriate type, e.g. `d = new Dog();`
- Variables and methods of a class are also called *members* of a class.
- Members of a class are accessed using **_dot notation_**.



**Constructor Example: **

```java
public class Dog {
    public int weightInPounds; // instance variable

  /*Constructor*/
    public Dog(int w) { // the instantiation is parameterized
        weightInPounds = w;
    }

    public void makeNoise() { // Non-static method OR Instance Method
    }
}
```

```java
public class DogLauncher {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog d = new Dog(20);
        d.makeNoise();
    }
}
```

The constructor with signature `public Dog(int w)` will be invoked anytime that we try to create a `Dog` using the `new` keyword and a single integer parameter.



####Terminology Summary 

```java
public class DogLauncher {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      Dog smallDog; // Declaration of a Dog variable
      new Dog(20); // Instantiation of the Dog class as a Dog object
      smallDog = new Dog(5); //Instantiation & Assignment
      Dog hugeDog = new Dog(150);//Declaration, Instantiation & Assignment
      smallDog.makeNoise();
      hugeDog.makeNoise();//Invocation of Dog class's instance method
    }
}
```



#### Array Instantiation, Arrays of Objects

```java
public class ArrayDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        /* Create an array of five integers. */
        int[] someArray = new int[5];
        someArray[0] = 3;
        someArray[1] = 4;
    }
}
```

```java
public class DogArrayDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        /* Create an array of two dogs. */
        Dog[] dogs = new Dog[2]; // create an array of Dog class
        dogs[0] = new Dog(8); 
        dogs[1] = new Dog(20);

        /* Yipping will result, since dogs[0] has weight 8. */
        dogs[0].makeNoise();
    }
}
```



#### Class Methods vs. Instance Methods

Two types of method in Java: 

- Static method (aka class method)
- Non-static method (aka instance method)

Static methods vs Non-Static methods

- Static methods are invoked using the class name, i.e. Dog.makeNoise()
  - actions that are taken by the class itself.
- Instance method are invoked using an instance name, i.e. `maya = new Dog(10); maya.makeNoise();`
  - are actions that can be taken only by a specific instance of a class

Example of Static Method:

```java
x = Math.sqrt(100);
```

The `Math` class provides a method called `sqrt`, since it is static, we can call `Math.sqrt()`



If `sqrt` had been an instance method, we would have instead the awkward syntax below. Luckily `sqrt` is a static method so we don't have to do this in real programs.

```java
Math m = new Math();
x = m.sqrt(100);
```



Another Example of Static Method:

```java
public static Dog maxDog(Dog d1, Dog d2) {
    if (d1.weightInPounds > d2.weightInPounds) {
        return d1;
    }
    return d2;
}
```

Invoke the method by:

```java
Dog d = new Dog(15);
Dog d2 = new Dog(100);
Dog.maxDog(d, d2);
```



Non-static approach:

```java
public Dog maxDog(Dog d2) {
    if (this.weightInPounds > d2.weightInPounds) {
        return this;
    }
    return d2;
}
```

```java
Dog d = new Dog(15);
Dog d2 = new Dog(100);
d.maxDog(d2);
```



#### Static Variables

```java
public class Dog {
    public int weightInPounds;
    public static String binomen = "Canis familiaris";
    ...
}
```

To access the static variable:

`className.variableName` , i.e. `Dog.binomen`



#### public static void main(String[] args)

- `public`: So far, all of our methods start with this keyword.
- `static`: It is a static method, not associated with any particular instance.
- `void`: It has no return type.
- `main`: This is the name of the method.
- `String[] args`: This is a parameter that is passed to the main method



#### Command Line Arguments

```java
public class ArgsDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(args[0]);
    }
}
```

```
$ java ArgsDemo these are command line arguments
these
```

In the example above, `args` will be an array of Strings, where the entries are {"these", "are", "command", "line", "arguments"}.
