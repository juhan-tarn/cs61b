# Intro to Java

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello world!");
    }
}
```

Java Syntax:

- All code in Java must be part of a class
- delimit segments using { }
- statement ends with semi-column
- For code to run we need `public static void main(string[] args)`

#### Running a Java file 

To compile a java file:

- `javac` file.java
- java file.class



Benefits of class file: 

- .class file has been type checked. distribute code is safer
- .class file is easier for the compiler to execute
- protects your intellectual property 





#### Variable & Loops

- declare variables before use
- Java variable **must** have specific types
- Java variables types can never change
- Types are verified before the code even runs



#### Static Type

- The compiler ensures that all types are compatible, making it easier for the programmer to debug their code
- Since the code is guaranteed to be free of type errors, users of your compiled programs will never run into type errors. For example, Android apps are written in Java, and are typically distributed only as .class files, i.e. in a compiled format. As a result, such applications should never crash due to a type error since they have already been checked by the compiler
- Every variable, parameter, and function has a declared type, making it easier for a programmer to understand and reason about code



#### Defining Functions in Java

- Functions must be declared as part of a class
- All functions are methods in Java
- Sample function definition: `public static`
- All parameters must have declared types, and the return value of the function must have a declared type
- Functions in Java only return one value
