## Lists

#### Primitive Type

```java
Walrus a = new Walrus(1000, 8.3);
Walrus b;
b = a;
b.weight = 5;
System.out.println(a);
System.out.println(b)
```

a and b print out the same thing as a and b points to the same object

```java
int x = 5;
int y;
y = x;
x = 2;
System.out.println("x is: " + x);
System.out.println("y is: " + y);
```

x and y will have different values

Each Java types has a different way to interpret the bits that get stored in the memory:

- 8 Primitive Types: 
  - byte
  - short
  - int
  - long 
  - float
  - double
  - boolean 
  - char 

- Declaring a variable of a certain type:
  - The computer sets aside exactly enough bits to hold the type
  - Java creates an internal table that maps each variable name to a location
  - Java does NOT write anything into the reserved boxes
    - For safety, Java will not let access a variable that is uninitialized



**The Golden Rule of Equals**

Given variables x and y:

y = x **copies** all the bits from x into y



```java
char c = 'H';
int x = c;
System.out.println(c); // prints 'H'
System.out.println(x); // prints 72
```





#### Reference Type

Everything other than the 8 primitive types are *Reference Type*

**Class Instantiation:**

When we instantiate an object:

- Java will first allocate a box of bits for each instance variable of the class and fills them up with a default value
- The constructor fills the value 



**Box Pointer Notation:** A non-zero address will be represented by an **arrow** pointing at an object instantiation.



#### Parameter Passing

Passing parameter also obeys to the the **Golden Rule of Equals**, simply copy the bits to the new scope ---> also refers as _**pass by value**_ 

In Java, always pass by value, meaning always copy the bits



**The Golden Rule Summary**

9 Types of variables in Java:

- 8 are primitive types
- 9th type is references to objects. References may be null
  - addresses are represented by arrow to object instances
- b = a **copies the bits** from a into b
- passing parameters **copies the bits**



```java
public class PassByValueFigure {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
           Walrus walrus = new Walrus(3500, 10.5);
           int x = 9;

           doStuff(walrus, x);
           System.out.println(walrus);
           System.out.println(x);
    }

    public static void doStuff(Walrus W, int x) {
           W.weight = W.weight - 100;
           x = x - 5;
    }
}
```

The above code does the following:

- doStuff creates two variables in its own scope
  - 64 bits walrus object type variable
    - w corresponds to the address of the parameter w, which is an object 
  - 32 bits int variable 
    - x gets the copied 32 bits representation of 9 
- w's weight gets decrement by 100
- the value of x in main remains 9
